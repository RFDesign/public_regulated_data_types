**NOTE**
ALL dsdl souce files must be named in CAMELCASE.
ALL folder directories MUST be in lowercase

Note that if the output directory is not specified explicitly via the command line option --outdir or -O, the default will be used, which is ./dsdlc_generated. It is recommended to exclude the output directory from version control, e.g. for git, add dsdlc_generated to the .gitignore config file.
